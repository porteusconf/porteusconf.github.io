# About
Forgive me if this is not too polished, as this is my first blog. I only occasionally post info I found useful, generally for computer end-users. You can start your own free blog on any topic(s) at github. One way to do so is at my first post at https://porteusconf.github.io/2020/01/14/welcome.html  It is dirt simple to write posts, since of course, it uses easy-to-learn [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) format.
