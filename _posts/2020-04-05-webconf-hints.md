### Web conferencing hints ###
#### General hints ####
* Require password (or similar safeguards) to enter meeting
* Quit any VPN before joining meeting(s).
* Update what you can. Note: Macos updates 2020-002 for 10.15/10.14/10.13 were breaking webcam and video-intensize apps like zoom until recent fixes: See [mrmactintosh.com](https://mrmacintosh.com/2020-002-update-causes-some-macs-to-freeze-when-using-hw-accelerated-video/)

#### Zoom hints ####
* Update zoom app. For desktop app: File: Check for updates  For ios: App Store. For android: google-play
* If zoom desktop app is using overheating or slowing your mac, or using up your battery, try "open in browser" instead of "Launch zoom.app". Unclear if issue was actually fixed when zoom closed it in June 2020 at [zoom dev formum](https://devforum.zoom.us/t/very-high-cpu-load-audio-video-problems-for-web-sdk/7937/29)
* UN-check "HD Video" (in settings)
* Mute your microphone whenever you are not speaking! (in settings, choose mute as default)
* Howto convert `*.zoom` and or `*.meetingrec` to mp4/mpeg/etc on double-click for win/mac/linux by assigning correct "open-with" app: [blog.plusmid.dev](https://blog.plusmid.dev/tags/convert/)

#### Teams hints ####
* Google-chrome works on macos (but not Safari/Firefox, even with hacks). 
* May not be reliable on older hardware/os. Example: Older android (4.4) got teams app 1416 from app-store. Can see chats, but reproducibly see lots of "something went wrong" (like trying to change status to active, or click on "Update" button in Play store).
