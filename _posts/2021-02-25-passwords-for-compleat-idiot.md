### Passwords for the compleat idiot
They say everyone should use a password manager, but I don't see a short simple procedure that anyone could follow, in 25-words or less. Here's my attempt.

Get a password manager (google for reviews). Note: Most require choosing a master password, but a few  do not, like [myki](https://myki.com/app/) which can use fingerprint on phone instead.

If you must choose a master password, the use:
 * 4 or more short randome words. (it is ok if all lower case to be easy to type, esp on smart phone. To see examples, click on "xkcd" preset at [https://xkpasswd.net/s/](https://xkpasswd.net/s/}
 *  and/or
 * answers to 4 obscure but personal questions [https://passwordbits.com/easy-master-password/](https://passwordbits.com/easy-master-password/)

Option. Add salt. A salt is wthe same few letters and/or numbers added before or after most important passwords. [HowTo use salt with password manager](https://passwordbits.com/salting-passwords/) A little easy extra assurance for those who feel a password manager puts all your eggs in one basket
